The following are sections and fields a processor must complete in order to have a Resource Record in ArchivesSpace. Use the information from your [Collection Description]({{ '/content/processing/collection-description.html' | relative_url }}) document to help fill out fields.

### Log into [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin)
- URL: [https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin).
- The username and password are established upon account creation.

### Create a Resource Record
##### Option 1:
- If the collection has a previous Accession Record, find it by searching in ArchivesSpace. 
- When found click "view" to view the record. Once at the record viewer window, in upper right hand corner select **Spawn**.
- Click on *Resource*.
    - This will create a Resource Record using some of the information filled from the Accession Record.

##### Option 2:
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Resource**.


The fields listed below should be filled for each resource record. Fields marked with * are mandatory (if information is known). Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.
