*The following manual is based on documentation created by Amy Thompson on how to create resource records in ArchivesSpace. It was updated in 2023 to reflect the most current departmental practices.*

Begin by reviewing that all steps of the [Accession Manual]({{ '/content/accessions/rehouse.html' | relative_url }}) are complete. This is especially important for donations that came in before 2017, when ArchivesSpace was adopted.

### Log into [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin)
- URL: [https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin).
- The username and password are established upon account creation.

### Create a Resource Record
##### Option 1:
- If the collection has a previous Accession Record, find it by searching in ArchivesSpace. 
- When found click "view" to view the record. Once at the record viewer window, in upper right hand corner select **Spawn**.
- Click on *Resource*.
    - This will create a Resource Record using some of the information filled from the Accession Record.

##### Option 2:
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Resource**.
