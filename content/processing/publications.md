### Publications

Sometimes during the processing stage, publications such as books, periodicals (journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.), and maps are found. Other times donors will drop off publications without much context. 
- For example, a patron drops off the Blot magazine with a note that says "For Special Collections" and no other information.

When these situations occur, first check the publication title against the Library's catalog at **[www.lib.uidaho.edu](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/)**. 

**If the publication *is not* found within the catalog:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the scope of the books collections. See the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) description for more information. Consult the Head of the department.
    - If adding to one of the book collections, contact the Library's Copy-Cataloger for them to add it.
    - If not adding to Spec stacks, follow the **Retention Rule** in Accession Record and Deed of Gift form.

**If the publication *is* already found within the catalog (multiple locations including Spec):**
1. Check the **Retention Rule** in Accession Record and Deed of Gift form for discard information.
    - If marked to be sent back to donor, contact them.
    - If marked to discard:
        - Place on Free Shelf (if considered of patron interest)
        - Discard (recycle or dumpster)

**If the publication *is* already found within the catalog but *not* in Spec:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the scope of the books collections. See the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) for more information Consult the Head of the department.
    - If adding to one of the book collections, contact the Library's Copy-Cataloger for them to add it.
    - If not adding to Spec stacks, follow the **Retention Rule** in Accession Record and Deed of Gift form.

**If the publication *is* already found in Spec, but the recently donated copy is *signed*:**
1. Check Spec stacks to see if current copy is signed. 
    - If current copy is 100% the same and but not signed, check to see if acquisition information is known.
    - If acquisition information is non-existent, swap the signed copy for the unsigned.
        - Add barcode and call number information to book being swapped in.
        - Erase barcode and call number information from book being swapped out.
        - Discard unsigned copy.

**If the publication *is* already found in Spec, but the it is number _____ out of ____, consult the Head of the department.**
 - Example: *The Vandal Jungle* by Jane Vandal was donated and only 100 were ever published. Spec already has one in the stacks and it is #65. The one that was donated is #3. Keep both copies.
