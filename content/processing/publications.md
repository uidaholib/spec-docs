Sometimes in when processing an accession, publications such as books, periodicals (journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.), and maps are found. Other times donors will drop off publications without much context. 
- For example, a patron drops off the Blot magazine with a note that says "For Special Collections" and no other information.
