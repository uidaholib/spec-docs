### Publications

Sometimes during the processing stage, publications such as books, periodicals (journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.), and maps are found. Other times donors will drop off publications without much context. 
- For example, a patron drops off the Blot magazine with a note that says "For Special Collections" and no other information.

When these situations occur, check the publication title against the Library's catalog at **[www.lib.uidaho.edu](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/)**. 

**If the publication *is* found within the catalog (main stacks and Spec):**
1. Check the **Retention Rule** in Accession Record and Deed of Gift form for discard information.
    - If marked to be sent back to donor, contact them.
    - If marked to discard:
        - Place on Free Shelf (if considered of patron interest)
        - Discard (recycle or dumpster)

**If the publication *is* found within the catalog but not in Spec:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the scope of the books collections. See the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) description for more information. Consult the Head of the department.
    - If adding to one of the book collections, contact the Library's Copy-Cataloger for them to add it to the selected collection.
    - If not adding to Spec stacks, follow the **Retention Rule** in Accession Record and Deed of Gift form.

**If the publication *is not* found within the catalog:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the scope of the books collections. See the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) description for more information. Consult the Head of the department.
