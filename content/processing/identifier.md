*The following manual is based on documentation created by Amy Thompson on how to create resource records in ArchivesSpace. It was updated in 2023 to reflect the most current departmental practices.*

Begin by reviewing that all steps of the [Accession Manual]({{ '/content/accessions/rehouse.html' | relative_url }}) are complete. This is especially important for donations that came in before 2017, when ArchivesSpace was adopted.

### Title and Identifier

The title will likely be the same unique name given to the donation during the accessioning process. The name of the person or group + type of records, such as papers, records, or collection. Assign the identifier based on the next available number in the List of All Processed Collections (found in SharePoint). If you have questions about the difference between MGs, UGs, and PGs, see the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) documentation.

#### Example

Accession Title/ID: 
<p> Jane and Joe Vandal music videos (UA 2035-87)</p>

This collection would turn into: 
<p>Jane and Joe Vandal music video collection (UG 608)</p>
