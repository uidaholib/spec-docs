*This manual is based on documentation created by Amy Thompson on how to create resource records in ArchivesSpace. It was updated in 2023 to reflect the most current departmental practices.*

Begin by reviewing that all steps of the **[Accession Manual]({{ '/content/accessions/rehouse.html' | relative_url }})** are complete. This is especially important for donations that came in before 2017, when ArchivesSpace was adopted. 

The following information will be needed to create a complete collection record in ArchivesSpace. 

{% capture text %}
**NOTE:** It is recommended processors should gather the following information into a single document before working in ArchivesSpace. Doing this allows more context to be added to a collection, as well as helps with grammatical errors.
{% endcapture %}

1. **Title:** The title will likely be the same unique name given to the donation. The name of the person/group + type of records, such as papers, records, or collection.
2. **Identifier:** Assign the identifier based on the next available number in the [List of All Collections](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/spec/Collections/Processed%20Collections/List%20of%20All%20Processed%20Collections.xlsx?d=w5ab19cc4fbee525e912b7bcd8afa738a&csf=1&web=1&e=cs00Gc&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMjAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0). If you have questions about the difference between MGs, UGs, and PGs, see the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) documentation.
3. **Dates:** The general dates represented in the collection, ex: 1927-1970.  
4. **Quantity:** The volume of the collection, ex: 2.5 c.f.  
5. **Accessions:** The accession(s) that went into the collection 
6. **Abstract:** 2-3 sentence description of the collection.  
7. **Scope/Content:** The type of records included in the collection as well as the topics or subjects covered in those records. 
8. **Bibliographical or Historical Note:** 
    - The biographical or historical note gives information about the creator of the collection, as well as the heavily documented subjects. It also can add context to the description by describing the subjects and people within their historical context. We describe collection with respect and care to the communities and events the materials may represent. Our goal is to ensure that our descriptions are inclusive, giving ample thought to if there is another perspective being left out.
        - When describing oppressive relationships, use active voice. This embeds responsibility within the description. Example: "Members of the Ohio National Guard killed four Kent State University students during a mass protest against the Vietnam War." IS BETTER THAN "Four Kent State University students were killed on May 4, 1970, during a clash between the Ohio National Guard and a crowd gathered to protest the Vietnam War."
        - Focus on the humanity of an individual before their identity/ies. Example: "...documents the business dealings of Maria, a Black woman..." IS BETTER THAN "...documents the business dealings of a Black woman named Maria..."
        - Refrain from using flowery language, valorizing collection creators
        - Refrain from including evaluative terms like "preeminent," "renowned," "genius," or "seminal." Ask yourself if this information helps users better understand the collection, or is only there to justify the creator's stature
        - Use accurate and strong language such as lynching, rape, murder, massacre, and hate mail when they are appropriate.
        - Do not let your discomfort with the terms censor the material. It is okay to be uncomfortable with racist material. It is not okay to privilege your discomfort above accurate description
        - Describe relationships of power when they are important for understanding the context of records. Racism, slurs, white supremacy, colonialism, and histories of oppression are important context.  Example: "Thomas Jefferson was a known enslaver despite his legacy as a supporter of individual rights."
        - Once you have finished writing a draft, look at it again and ask yourself:
            - Which audiences does this description center?
            - Which audiences does it exclude?" (ARDR, p. 4)â€¯
