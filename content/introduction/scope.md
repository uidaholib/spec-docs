Within Spec there are two primary classes of materials: university and manuscript collections.

### University Collections
---

The **University Collection** is comprised of items related to the history of U of I, the work of its faculty, and the experiences of its students. Particularly strong components of the University Collection include:
- The Argonaut student newspaper 
- Gem of the Mountains yearbook 
- Extension Services and 4-H 
- Social life 
- Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) 
- University publications 
- University presidential papers 

### Manuscript Collections
---

The **Manuscript Collection** is comprised of those materials that are not directly connected to U of I. Spec has traditionally focused on the following subject areas in its Manuscript Collection:
- Mining  
- Forestry 
- Idaho 

Spec has also identified secondary or emerging subject areas for the manuscripts collection:
- Environmentalism and Environmental Conservation 
- Women and Marginalized Communities 
- Science Fiction 
- LGBTQIA+ 
- Military 

### Other Archival Collections
---
#### Photograph Groups

Photographs are a significant primary source type within Spec holdings and as such large collections have been catalogued as distinct record sets using the designation Photograph Group.  

#### Small MGs

Some collections are very small (i.e. one item in one folder). When those are processed, they are given a Small Manuscript Group identifier that start with the number **5** and shelved in the Small MG storage area. 

For example, MG 5831 is the [Isabel Miller Sci-Fi collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv250330) consisting of 3 items in one folder.

#### International Jazz Collection

In 2007, the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival's archival holdings were transferred to Spec. At that time [International Jazz Collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) was added to Spec priorities.   

A variety of material types are present in the University, Manuscript, and International Jazz Collections. The preponderance of material is documentary in nature. Spec has long collected audio and more recently video recordings. A limited amount of visual artwork, both framed and unframed, has been accepted. Objects or regalia also make up a small but important part of the collections.  
 
#### Vertical Files
Items of an ephemeral nature documenting the University of Idaho, state of Idaho, and American West. Collections include athletics, campus life and culture, university departments, employees, memorabilia, and Idaho subjects. 

#### Book Collections

Spec has been collecting Rare Books for many decades. It consists of those books which, because of their artifact or association qualities, must be provided more attention and care. These include early imprints, such as incunabula (books published between 1450 and 1500); significant works from famous presses; volumes with exceptional bindings or illustrations; and first editions of landmark books. See [Books, Periodicals, and Serials]({{ '/content/tips-tricks/books.html' | relative_url }}) for general book locations.

| Collection Title | Description |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| Day-Northwest (Day-NW) | Named after U of I Regent Jerome J. Day, whose donated collection of western Americana was the basis for creating this collection. This now includes any published item with Idaho as a topic, subject or setting, published items on the history, culture, peoples, environment, etc. of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest, items authored by University of Idaho professors, non-UI theses and dissertations with an Idaho topic. Material types include books, periodicals, media, reports, maps/atlases. |
| Day-NW Engerbretson | In general catalog but shelved separately. This is collection focuses on fly-fishing. It is made up of two separate donations, MA 2012-14 (Duke Parkening Collection) and MA 2011-27 (David Engerbretson Papers). It was given the prefix of Day-NW because the catalog we were using at the time wouldn’t allow any more collections to be added. They were shelved separately due to space constraints. |
| Idaho | Spec is an Idaho state repository, so this collection includes any items published by an Idaho governmental agency. For example, the University of Idaho, Idaho State Transportation Department, State Legislative proceedings. |
| President's Collection (Pres Col) | This small collection is any published item that was donated to and inscribed to a university president, that the president’s office has decided should be kept. |
| Spec | Rare books: first editions, artist books, incunabula, limited editions/printings. |
| Day2 | A collection of English classics, noted for their fine bindings, also donated by Jerome J. Day. |
| IJC | Published items relating to the history of jazz. The collection originated from items included with the Leonard Feather collection. |
| Caxton | Any items published by Caxton Press or Caxton Printers of Caldwell, Idaho. |
| Twain | A collection of books published by or about Mark Twain, donated by Donald D. Fraser. |
| Thesis and Dissertations | Theses and dissertations authored by University of Idaho students. Also includes some professional papers written as a degree requirement. |
| Pound | Books published by or about Ezra Pound. This collection was established in 1973 to honor the memory of Ezra Pound, who was born in Hailey, ID. In 1974, the Library, the Department of English, and the Department of Foreign Languages sponsored a guest speaker to discuss the poetry of Ezra Pound, the first of the annual Pound Lectures in the Humanities which lasted until the early 1980s. |
| Scott | Books published by or about Sir Walter Scott. The collection originated from a donation by U of I Zoology Professor Earl Larrison in 1962. |
| Stonewall | A collection of every book submitted to the American Library Association’s Stonewall Book Awards, donated by Lewis Brian Day, from the creation of the award in 1971 up through 2013. |
| Sci-Fi | Science Fiction books primarily taken from MG 470 (Victoria Mitchell collection on Science Fiction). Also books purchased by or about Edward Elmer “Doc” Smith, including MG 469 (Richard Dodson Collection on E. E. "Doc" Smith and Science Fiction). Cataloging is on hold until Spec procedures are finalized. |
| Non-UI Yearbooks | In general catalog but shelved separately. Single editions of Idaho high school and non-U of I college yearbooks. | 
| Naskali Collection | Uncatalogued collection of books separated from MG 468 (Richard Naskali papers), focusing on botany, horticulture, and gardening/landscaping. Also includes the Arbor collection, which is catalogued but suppressed from public view. |

Additionally there are uncataloged phonebooks and city directories for many Idaho cities, counties, and statewide, as well as surrounding states. (*Payette region ones are cataloged and in Alma/Primo).

#### Born-Digital and Hybrid Collections

In keeping with U of I Library's mission, Special Collections and Archives serves as the caretaker of digital archival resources. The term born-digital refers to materials that have never been or do not have any analog (physical) equivalents. Digital preservation refers to the series of managed activities which are necessary to ensure long-term access to digital materials. Dark archives are archives that cannot be accessed by any current users but may be accessible at future dates or upon request. The general scope covers:

- Born-digital materials, both library resources and institutional records (including but not limited to photographs, documents, datasets, and electronic records), 
- Products of digitization projects (preservation master digital surrogate files and associated metadata), 
- Items or collection for the community that Spec has accepted a curatorial role for, 
- Digitized materials with no available analog (no available print or re-digitization not possible due to material instability), and 
- Digitized materials with available analog (cost of re-digitizing weighed against preserving existing digital copies and physical materials)

- U of I English Department records = UA/UG
- Joe Vandal, an English Department professor = MA/MG
- Community group corporate records = MA/MG
- USB of photographs from Jazz Fest = UA/IJC MG
- Donation of photographs from a famous regional photographer = MA/PG
- Argonaut photograph transfer = UA/PG
