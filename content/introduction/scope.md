Within Spec there are two primary classes of materials: 

### University Collections

The **University Collection** is comprised of items related to the history of U of I, the work of its faculty, and the experiences of its students. Particularly strong components of the University Collection include:
- The Argonaut student newspaper 
- Gem of the Mountains yearbook 
- Extension Services and 4-H 
- Social life 
- Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) 
- University publications 
- University presidential papers 

### Manuscript Collections

The **Manuscript Collection** is comprised of those materials that are not directly connected to U of I. Spec has traditionally focused on the following subject areas in its Manuscript Collection:
- Mining  
- Forestry 
- Idaho 

Spec has also identified secondary or emerging subject areas for the manuscripts collection:
- Environmentalism and Environmental Conservation 
- Women and Marginalized Communities 
- Science Fiction 
- LGBTQIA+ 
- Military 

**International Jazz Collection**

In 2007, the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival's archival holdings were transferred to Spec. At that time [International Jazz Collection](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/) was added to Spec priorities.   

A variety of material types are present in the University, Manuscript, and International Jazz Collections. The preponderance of material is documentary in nature. Spec has long collected audio and more recently video recordings. A limited amount of visual artwork, both framed and unframed, has been accepted. Objects or regalia also make up a small but important part of the collections.  

**Photograph Groups**

Photographs are a significant primary source type within Spec holdings and as such large collections have been catalogued as distinct record sets using the designation Photograph Group.  

**Rare Books**

Spec has been collecting Rare Books for many decades. It consists of those books which, because of their artifact or association qualities, must be provided more attention and care. These include early imprints, such as incunabula (books published between 1450 and 1500); significant works from famous presses; volumes with exceptional bindings or illustrations; and first editions of landmark books. Some of the largest or most notable holdings concentrate on the following: 
- Northwest History 
- Ezra Pound 
- Sir Walter Scott 
- Caxton Press publications 
- Science Fiction (part of the V.E. Mitchell Collection) 
- University of Idaho Thesis and Dissertations (until printing ended in about 2019) 

**Born-Digital and Hybrid Collections** 

In keeping with U of I Library's mission, Special Collections and Archives serves as the caretaker of digital archival resources. The term born-digital refers to materials that have never been or do not have any analog (physical) equivalents. Digital preservation refers to the series of managed activities which are necessary to ensure long-term access to digital materials. Dark archives are archives that cannot be accessed by any current users but may be accessible at future dates or upon request. The general scope covers:

- Born-digital materials, both library resources and institutional records (including but not limited to photographs, documents, datasets, and electronic records), 
- Products of digitization projects (preservation master digital surrogate files and associated metadata), 
- Items or collection for the community that Spec has accepted a curatorial role for, 
- Digitized materials with no available analog (no available print or re-digitization not possible due to material instability), and 
- Digitized materials with available analog (cost of re-digitizing weighed against preserving existing digital copies and physical materials)
