#### Duplicates Exist!
If you are looking for a negative/print and can't find it in the folder or box it's supposed to be, try checking the **Copy Negatives** area in the book storage.
- Row 37 (by the table that has things stacked to be put back)
- If a print can't be found, likely a copy negative of it is located here.
