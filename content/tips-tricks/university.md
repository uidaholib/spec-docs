### University/Extension Publications
---
Each college had its own series of publications (Ag Extension, CALS, CNR, Forestry, Mines, general University) 
- The most common series is “bulletin” so each one of those colleges has its own bulletin series. 

There is no master list of each of these titles of series, nor of individual publications.  
- Eve Gentry worked in CALS publishing for a couple of years and was trying to make a list and reconcile what they had with what was in the library. She sent us boxes of publications based on what she thought we still needed to fill gaps.  
- There is an unfinished list of all series/publications: [All Extension Publications](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/spec/Collections/Book%20Collections/UnanalyzedSerials/All%20Extension%20Publications.xlsx?d=weffbed4177fd4232aaeecfc4bad20cbf&csf=1&web=1&e=kChTYa&nav=MTVfezZFMzEzNjE2LUNGMzgtNDg1QS1BRUY5LTZFQTdGNzBDQkQxQ30).
- Also an unfinished list of all [CALS/AG series titles](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/spec/Collections/Book%20Collections/UnanalyzedSerials/CALSSerials/ag%20publications%20all%20titles.docx?d=w26bc383044db51edbc500e1db5ced6c5&csf=1&web=1&e=2n7EPI).

Extension/University Publications are very hit and miss in the catalog (ALMA/Primo).  
- Some are only cataloged at the series level, even if the individual items have their own titles. Old lists of individual titles under their series are here [UnanalyzedSerials](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/spec/Collections/Book%20Collections/UnanalyzedSerials?csf=1&web=1&e=pWdNn8).
- Some are cataloged at the series level and the item level, giving them multiple records 
- If any series changed names even slightly a new catalog record was created 
- Some are only cataloged at the individual title level, and might or might not include which series they are a part of 

Individual publications can be within multiple series (e.g. Bulletin and Contribution Number)
