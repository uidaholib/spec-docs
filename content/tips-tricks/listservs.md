### Northwest Archivists (NWA)
- NWA doesnâ€™t have listserv, but it is our most proximate professional association. They do send out email blasts if you are a member, and they are always looking for people to get involved. U of I Library more than likely will not cover membership fees, but as a non-member check out their page for news, events, etc. at: [https://northwestarchivistsinc.wildapricot.org/](https://northwestarchivistsinc.wildapricot.org/)
