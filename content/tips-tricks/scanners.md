#### Flatbed Scanner
Sometimes the scanner by the small white printer freezes or the computer says it can't connect to it.
- Turn the scanner off. Wait 30 seconds. Turn it back on and wait a few minutes. Then try the program again.

#### Negative Scanner
Can't find the right negative adapter? Check the *Accessories* drawer!
