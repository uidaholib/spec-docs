As of 2023, work published in the U.S. prior to 1928 is in the **public domain**. This changes each year. No permission is need to copy or use public domain works. When something is being used from the archives that is in public domain, ask that reproductions include information about the source ([Citations]({{ '/content/practices-procedures/citations.html' | relative_url }})).

For **copyright** information, see [Copyright Practices]({{ '/content/practices-procedures/copyright.html' | relative_url }})
