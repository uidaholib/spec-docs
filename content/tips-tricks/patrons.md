When a patron contacts Spec and their inquiry is detailed, answering their questions or requests may be cut and dry.

However, sometimes a patron request isn't very clear. In those cases, asking for clarification or even asking more questions about the subject might help narrow down a scope of research.

Then there are times when a patron has a very broad topic and doesn't quite know what they're looking for. In this situation it might be beneficial to send the patron some How-To PDFs. That way patrons can do their own search, and then contact us with the materials they'd like to view.

When prompted to find a **digital assets**, see whether the finding aid record includes the file names. Look for these in the Archive Drive. Ask colleagues for help if issues arise.
