As stated in the Scope of Collections, [Vertical Files]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) are Items of an ephemeral nature documenting the University of Idaho, state of Idaho, and American West. Collections include athletics, campus life and culture, university departments, employees, memorabilia, and Idaho subjects.

Most of these VFs have an ArchivesSpace spreadsheet on SharePoint for tracking new materials and easy upload. See the [Vertical Files](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/spec/Collections/Vertical%20Files?csf=1&web=1&e=hv70VN) folder for those spreadsheets.
