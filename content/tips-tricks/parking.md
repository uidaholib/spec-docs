The following is information for patrons who require information about parking options when visiting campus. You may copy/paste the following language but *make sure links work* first:


Full-day visitor permits are available for purchase from Parking and Transportation Services here: [https://uidaho.aimsparking.com/](https://uidaho.aimsparking.com/). Visitor permits are $4 per day and allow for parking in any color-coded parking lot around campus. A Gold lot is located about two blocks from the University of Idaho Library, and there are Orange and Red lots not too much farther away. 

There are a few metered parking spaces along Rayburn Street by the Library, but they may be occupied during normal business hours. 

Additional information about parking, including campus parking maps, may be found on the Parking and Transportation Services site: [Parking and Transportation Services](https://www.uidaho.edu/parking).
