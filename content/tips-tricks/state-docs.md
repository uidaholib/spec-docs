### Processing State Documents

State documents arrive periodically. When received:
1. Mark off items received on shipping invoice, and place invoice in cabinet.
    - Note: Not everything on list gets received (i.e. always more on the list than in box).
2. Check to item against [Idaho State Docs VF](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv741282) or [Library catalog](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/).
3. If found in VF, add item to collection.
4. If it goes into a book collection, label using **green** or **orange** bookmarks (i.e. Idaho, Day-NW, etc.) and take to cataloger.
    - Green = Idaho; Orange = Day-NW (or other collection)
5. When returned, shelve.
