#### Checking for New Material
Check the mail room on the 4th floor (door across from elevator) for materials added to Spec book collections by the catalogers.
- If there are periodicals that *do not* have a white, acid-free bookmark with a barcode and call number written on it then:
    - Log into [Alma](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/ng/)
        - Contact the Library's Associate Dean for Operations and Access for account setup.
    - Search for the periodical by title
    - Once the correct publication is found, check that the added volume or issue is in the system.
        - If in the system, write the call number somewhere on the cover or inside page **in pencil**.
            - Then shelve.
        - If *not* in the system, contact a cataloger.
- If materials have a bookmark with barcode and call number, shelve in appropriate book collection area.

### Idaho Law Code
Every so often Spec will receive updated Idaho Law books. These are located in the **Idaho Book Collection**.
- Swap out any new law code books.
- Place older copy in Cage 1, Row, Section, 
    - Do not withdraw catalog from Alma, or change locations.
