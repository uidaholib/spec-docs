title: Clickable Links in AS & AW
---

While doing Biographical/Historical research to complete the Resource Record fields in ArchivesSpace, a processor may want to link back to research they used. To have a clickable link, copy and paste: 

`<extref linktype="simple" title="webpage" show="new" href="PASTE LINK HERE" actuate="onrequest">WORDS OR LINK</extref>.`

Examples: 

{% include figure.html img="biblio.jpg" alt="bibliography example with links" caption="" width="" %}

See the [Frank Ankenbrand, Jr. - Ezra Pound Family papers](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv248676) finding aid to view the *blue*, clickable links in the **Bibliography** section.
