The [Idaho Harvester](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu) is a blog run by Special Collections and Archives. It features collections, projects, exhibits, and other news involving materials from Spec. This blog uses GitHub, CollectionBuilder, and Visual Studio Code to run and update. A GitHub account must be created, and colleagues must add the account to the blog's repository.

To see how to write a blog, see the [Idaho Harvester Blog and Working Collection Wiki](https://github.com/uidaholib/spec-lumber/wiki).
