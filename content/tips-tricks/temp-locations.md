Sometimes collections aren't on their allocated shelf. This could be because they're getting digitized in CDIL, they're in the Reading Room for a patron, or pulled for a display. Check the **Instances** section in the ArchivesSpace record for a possible secondary location.

<div class="text-center mb-2">
    <a href="#{{ 'To Add A Temporary Location To A Record:' | slugify }}" class="btn btn-secondary my-2 mx-1">Add Temporary Location</a>
    <a href="#{{ 'To Remove A Temporary Location From A Record:' | slugify }}" class="btn btn-secondary my-2 mx-1">Remove Temporary Location</a>
</div>
