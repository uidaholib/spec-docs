*The following framework was adapted from the [University of Buffalo Libraries Special Collections](https://research.lib.buffalo.edu/digitalpreservation/processing).*

Like physical collections, digital assets transferred or gifted to the department will undergo the same accessioning and processing procedures. For more information on how to accession materials, please view the Spec Practices and Procedures Manual. Staff members must be certain to include donor documentation and whatever digital storage information there is upon donation. Before beginning the processing stage, staff members will follow a digital processing framework in order to accurately understand what the scope is.

1. Reviewing accession record and other documentation about provenance.
2. Identify and document scope and contents of items, and if there are access restrictions (i.e. copyright, personal information, donor restrictions, etc.). 
3. Determine materials that are digital only (hybrid collections) and extent. 
4. Determine collection level information and date range. 
{% endcapture %}

{% capture text %}
1. Determine the priority of processing the collection and the level of access needed. 
2. Identify the scope and level of collection description. 
3. Review descriptive and arrangement needs of collection for patron discovery.

{% capture text %}
1. Review what the media is (i.e. floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, zip drives, electronic transfer, etc.). 
2. Assign a unique identifier (PG, MG, or UG). 
3. Create an inventory for each media storage item using the Media Inventory spreadsheet template. 
4. Add inventory information to ArchivesSpace Resource Record. 
5. Rehouse media if necessary and label with new identifier.

{% capture text %}
1. Capture content off physical storage, perform virus scan, create checksums, and preservation and access copies of assets. 
- See Procedures for Digital Asset Ingesting. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html header="Ingest content:" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
1. Complete the accession and processing procedures in ArchivesSpace using the Spec Practices & Procedures Manual. 
- If using the AS upload template, see the Digital Materials and AS Template guideline. 
- Please note some fields will need alternate wording and/or selections when processing digital assets. For those specific requirements, see the Digital Material Processing and Descriptions in AS guidelines. 
- If Personal Identification Information (PII) is found, discounting accessioning or processing and make a restriction on access note in AS.

{% capture text %}PlEASE NOTE: 
Some accessions with digital assets have already been ingested via FRED. The full list is located here: Collections with Digital Materials. If a staff member is processing an accession and comes across a type of digital item, check against the list to determine whether ingesting is the next step. If a collection has been fully processed and digital materials had been previously ingested, be sure to change the accession number to the processed collection ID.{% endcapture %}
