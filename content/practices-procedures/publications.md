### Publications

Sometimes publications such as books, periodicals (journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.), and maps are donated with or without context. When these situations occur, first check the publication title against the Library's catalog at **[www.lib.uidaho.edu](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/)**. 

**If the publication *is not* found within the catalog:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) and consult the Head.
2. If adding to a book collection:
    - Place **green or orange bookmark** inside to identify the collection. Green = Day-NW; Orange = Idaho (or other collection). Located in processing room.
    - Give item to cataloger so they add it in Alma.
3. If **not** adding to Spec stacks, follow the *Retention Rule* noted in the Accession Record or Deed of Gift form.

**If the publication *is* found within the catalog (multiple locations including Spec):**
1. Check the *Retention Rule* noted in the Accession Record or Deed of Gift form for discard information.

**If the publication *is* found within the catalog but *not* in Spec:**
1. Determine whether the item fits within the [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}) and consult the Head.
2. If adding to a book collection:
    - Place **green or orange bookmark** inside to identify the collection. Green = Day-NW; Orange = Idaho (or other collection). Located in processing room.
    - Give item to cataloger so they add it in Alma.
3. If **not** adding to Spec stacks, follow the *Retention Rule* noted in the Accession Record or Deed of Gift form.

**If the publication *is* in Spec, but the recently donated copy is *signed*:**
1. Check Spec stacks to see if current copy is signed. 
    - If current copy is 100% the same and but not signed, check to see if acquisition information is known.
    - If acquisition information is non-existent, swap the signed copy for the unsigned.
        - Add barcode and call number information to book being swapped in.
        - Erase barcode and call number information from book being swapped out.
        - Discard unsigned copy.

**If the publication *is* in Spec, but the it is number ____ out of ____, consult the Head of the department.**
   - Example: *The Vandal Jungle* by Jane Vandal was donated and only 100 were ever published. Spec already has one in the stacks and it is #65. The one that was donated is #3. Keep both copies.

### Periodicals
- If magazines, journals, newsletters, or newspapers given to Spec have a bookmark with barcode and call number, shelve in appropriate area.
    - EX: Day-NW NF456 J7 2041
- If materials given to Spec *do not* have a **white, acid-free bookmark with a barcode and call number** written then:
    1. Log into [Alma](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/ng/).
        - Contact the Library's Associate Dean for Operations and Access for account setup.
    2. Search for item by title.
    3. Double check that the added issue is in Alma.
        - If in the system, write the call number somewhere on the cover or inside page **in pencil**. Shelve.
        - If *not* in the system, contact cataloger.

### Maps

Maps can be found in Spec book collections as well as Manuscript and University collections. However, the Library also has a [Map Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/maps/) which is located on the 1st floor in the Data Hub. 

**If a found map does *not* fit within Spec's [Scope of Collections]({{ '/content/introduction/scope.html' | relative_url }}):**
1. Check the collection's **Retention Rule** noted in the Accession Record or Deed of Gift form.
2. If marked to be sent back to donor, contact them.
3. If marked to discard:
    - Contact the Library's Associate Dean for Operations and Access. They may want to add it to the [Map Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/maps/). Let them know to discard if not chosen to be added.
