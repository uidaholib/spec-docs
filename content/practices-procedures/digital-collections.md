Archival digitization can sometimes turn into a larger project such as creating a digital collection. Departments who usually participate in this initiative include [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/), [Data and Digital Services](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/dds.html), and the Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). A majority of the digital collections are created using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/). This system generates sites by metadata and powered by static web-technology.

**NOTE:** Metadata used to complete ArchivesSpace Accession and Resource Records for finding aids is *not* the same as metadata for digital collections. Be sure to follow the instructions for creating a digital collection closely.
