Primary sources obtained from Spec should be cited appropriately. Citation formats very depending upon the discipline, but in general should include author or creator's name, title of the work or specific item, date of publication or production, publication information, collection title, box and folder number, or photograph number, and the name of the repository. 

The following formats are used by Spec when citing works for publications, exhibits, and reference.
