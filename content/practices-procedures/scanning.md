Spec scans archival materials for patron inquiries, inter-departmental requests, and other digitization projects such as digital collections. When a *part* or a *whole* collection has been scanned, they are marked with orange "SCANNED" stickers (located in the processing room).

{% capture text %}
**NOTE:** Before scanning check the **Archive Drive** to see whether something has already been scanned! If you don't have access to the drive, contact the Digital Archivist.
{% endcapture %}

When transferring files to patrons that are too large to send via email, use the *free* file transfer site [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/). Creating a free account is *not* required.

Documentation and instruction for scanning and processing scans can be found on the University of Idaho Library [Digital Collections Team documentation site](https://uidaholib.github.io/digital-collections-docs/content/dc-team.html). Procedures covered: file naming; scanning images, negatives, and documents; processing images and documents; batch converting file types; and editing in PhotoShop.
