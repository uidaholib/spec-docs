Spec scans archival materials for patron inquiries, inter-departmental requests, and other digitization projects such as digital collections. When a *part* or a *whole* collection has been scanned, they are marked with orange "SCANNED" stickers (located in the processing room).

{% capture text %}
**NOTE:** Before scanning check the **Archive Drive** to see whether something has already been scanned! If you don't have access to the drive, contact the Digital Archivist.

When transferring files to patrons that are too large to send via email, use the *free* file transfer site [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/). Creating a free account is *not* required.

Documentation and instruction for scanning and processing scans can be found on the University of Idaho Library [Digital Collections Team documentation site](https://uidaholib.github.io/digital-collections-docs/content/dc-team.html). Procedures covered: file naming; scanning images, negatives, and documents; processing images and documents; batch converting file types; and editing in PhotoShop.
