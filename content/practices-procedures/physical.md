### Accession Procedures

If materials are deemed appropriate for inclusion in Spec, they will be accessioned. Manuscript, university, or photograph collections that have been accessioned will be noted with an identifying number beginning with **MA** or **UA**. For a step-by-step guide to accessioning, see *insert link to accession procedures*. 

The following is a summary of steps which make up the accessioning process:  
1. If items cannot be accessioned immediately upon receipt, place items on shelving in intake area, as space allows, along with the completed Deed of Gift. 
2. Add an *accession* record to [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin) that includes donor and collection information, an accession number, and a preliminary inventory. 
3. Rehouse the materials if appropriate to condense for space saving or material stability. 
4. Assess how important the materials are to departmental priorities and make a note in the *Processing Prioritization List* (found in SharePoint). 
5. Find a temporary shelf location and note that in the AS accession record. 
6. Print **Accession Report** from AS and place in appropriate accession binder along with the Deed of Gift and/or any relevant communications. 
7. Work with department Head to ensure that a *thank-you* note is sent to the donor, when applicable (found in SharePoint). 

### Processing Procedures

Accessioned materials are made more useful and accessible through processing. Even a minimal level of processing should be the goal for all collections. While some collections may warrant a very thorough processing, box or folder-level descriptions should suffice in most instances. The level of detail should be determined by the complexity or variety of materials, the size of the collection, and a professional assessment of the collection's importance. This is a subjective process. For a step-by-step guide, see *insert link to processing*.  

The following is a summary of steps which should be used to process a collection:  

1. Create an inventory in a spreadsheet template (found in SharePoint); the template will later be imported into [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin)
- If the collection is very small, it may be more efficient to work directly in AS 
2. Rehouse the collection (if not completed at time of accession) 
- Weed to remove personally sensitive or irrelevant materials, like financial receipts or medical records 
- Utilize acid-free housing materials
        - Guidance from the National Archives should be used when making decisions about rehousing materials[^1]
- Make a professional determination of the best order for collection 
        - Original order is preferred in the archival field 
        - If collection bares no evidence of imposed order from the creator, subject or chronological order may be appropriate 
3. Create summary, scope of contents, biographical/historical statements in AS 
4. Identify subject tags in AS 
5. Complete finding aid 
- Assign ARK Number using AW Tools Site 
- Flag offensive material 
- Complete all required AS fields 
6. Upload record to ArchivesWest using AW Tools Site 
7. Shelve in final location and make note of location in AS

### Deaccessioning Practices

Every effort should be made to review donations and remove unneeded or inappropriate items before accessioning. Should an accessioned collection prove to contain materials later deemed to fall outside of retention guidelines, staff may choose to deaccession items. The department Head should be consulted in such an event.

1. Does not fit within the scope of collecting for Spec 
2. Does not have an identifiable enduring value or presents a poor case for use 
3. Spec does not have the capacity to adequately preserve the medium 
4. The volume of the material puts strain on limited storage space 
5. Poor condition threatens long-term use and/or the condition of other materials  
6. Present concerns about personal privacy 
7. Duplicate copies of existing Spec holdings 
8. Non-unique and mass-produced

When an item(s) is removed from an accessioned collection, a note should be made in the [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin) record and any existing or future [Archives West](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/search.php?r=idu) finding aid to convey what type and volume of materials were removed. An example might be "1.5 cubic feet of materials removed for containing personal financial records."  

Deaccessioned items may be disposed of in a variety of ways. If indicated on the Deed of Gift form, the donor has the right to first refusal. If a donor's contact information is no longer current, or the donor is no longer alive, efforts should be made to find another relevant contact. If the donor is not interested in taking back materials, follow these general guidelines.  
- Publications of interest may be offered to library liaisons 
- Unique materials in good condition and not containing personally sensitive material may be offered to another preservation organization, like a historical society, museum, or another archive 
- Mass produced materials without a strong connection to any specific repository should be recycled 
- Items in poor condition should be disposed of appropriately

[^1]: “The groups of records selected for holdings maintenance projects are chosen after weighing a variety of archival considerations, including intrinsic value, condition, and anticipated use of the records. In some instances it may be appropriate to do no more than rebox, or refolder and rebox a records series; in other cases, it will be appropriate to carry out the complete range of holdings maintenance actions.” (p. 3); “Boxes that are physically damaged (exhibiting such characteristics as broken hinges or missing flaps) and no longer capable of supporting or protecting archival records adequately should be replaced with new storage containers. Boxes of unknown or suspect quality should be tested for pH level and alkaline reserve, to determine whether they should be replaced with new acid-free or low-lignin boxes.” (p. 4); “Folders that are physically damaged and no longer capable of protecting or supporting archival records should be replaced. Folders of unknown or suspect quality should be tested for the pH level and alkaline reserve, to determine whether they should be replaced with new folders.” (p. 4-5).
