The **Related Accessions** section of the Accession Record should be filled out if you know there are other accessions that belong in the same collection.  

1. Select *Add Related Accession*. 
2. In the *Relationship type* drop-down menu, usually choose **Is Sibling of**.
- The language here is confusing. It has to do with hierarchies (Does an accession fall under a previous accession or is it on the same level).  
3. In the **Sibling Relationship** box, fill out the required fields.
- *This Accession* = Is Sibling of
- *Accession* = Search for the related accession you are trying to connect to. Hint: Using the drop-down menu here to *Browse* might be easier when searching.
- *Relator Type* = Automates with "Bound With" relationship.
