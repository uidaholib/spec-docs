### Create an Accession Record
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Accessions**.

**NOTE:** ArchivesSpace requires only 3 fields to create an accession record: *Title, Identifier,* and *Accession Date*. However, these fields are not enough to create a good accession record and it’s important to include more information. You can save a record at any point. You can leave and come back to a record, but be sure to click the blue save button at the top of the record or at the bottom of the left-hand menu.

### Related Accessions

The **Related Accessions** section of the Accession Record should be filled out if you know there are other accessions that belong in the same collection.  

1. Select *Add Related Accession*. 
2. In the *Relationship type* drop-down menu, usually choose **Is Sibling of**.
- The language here is confusing. It has to do with hierarchies (Does an accession fall under a previous accession or is it on the same level).  
3. In the **Sibling Relationship** box, fill out the required fields.
- *This Accession* = Is Sibling of
- *Accession* = Search for the related accession you are trying to connect to. Hint: Using the drop-down menu here to *Browse* might be easier when searching.
- *Relator Type* = Automates with "Bound With" relationship.

### Instances

The **Instances** section of the Accession Record is used to track location of materials. If this *isn't* used, just note location the **User Defined** section in *String 1*. Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.

{:.table .table-bordered}
| Field | Required | Content | Examples |
| - | ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Type | Yes | Drop-down menu, typically just use *Accession* for accession records |
| Top Container | Yes | From drop-down menu, select best description. Usually, *Box*. |
| Container Type | Optional | From drop-down menu, select *Create* |
| Indicator | Yes | An alphanumeric expression for indicating the place of the highest level container, which may also be the position of the container in a sequence of containers. | Container Type = Box & Indicator = 1 so... Box 1 |

Once **Container Type** and **Indicator** are filled in, you could *Add Location* if one is known. 
- Location* > Browse (drop-down)> choose the exact location. You can filter by text or by links to rooms/areas (for example, type in ‘row: 94’ in the keyword search box to find the small accession shelves).
- Click *Link to Locations*.
- If location isn't known, this can be edited and added later. 

In bottom left corner click *Create and Link to Top Container*.

Repeat this for every box. To add more, hover over the bottom of the Instance field and “Add Container Instance” and “Add Digital Object” will appear. Click on “Add Container Instance”. 

When you are finished with the record save and print. For now, print using CTRL + P, or go to the **View** screen of the record (not in Edit mode) and print from there.
