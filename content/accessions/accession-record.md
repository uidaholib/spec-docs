The following is based on the Accessions Manual created by Ashlyn Velte in 2018 and subsequently updated by Amy Thompson in 2019 and 2022. It was again updated in 2023 by Dulce Kersting-Lark and Sara Szobody.

- The username and password are established upon account creation.

### Create an Accession Record.
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Accessions**.

#### Fill in Basic Information

**NOTE:** AS only requires 3 fields to create an accession record: *Title, Identifier,* and *Accession Date*. However, these fields are not enough to create a good accession record and it’s important to include more information. You can save a record at any point. You can leave and come back to a record but be sure to click save. The save button is at the top of the record.

The fields listed below should be filled for each accession record. Fields marked with * are mandatory (if information is known). Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.
