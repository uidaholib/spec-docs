**NOTE:** AS only requires 3 fields to create an accession record: *Title, Identifier,* and *Accession Date*. However, these fields are not enough to create a good accession record and it’s important to include more information. You can save a record at any point. You can leave and come back to a record but be sure to click save. The save button is at the top of the record.
{% endcapture %}

{% include alert.html text=staff-note color="warning" %}
