### Create an Accession Record
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Accessions**.

**NOTE:** AS only requires 3 fields to create an accession record: *Title, Identifier,* and *Accession Date*. However, these fields are not enough to create a good accession record and it’s important to include more information. You can save a record at any point. You can leave and come back to a record but be sure to click save. The save button is at the top of the record.

The **Related Accessions** section of the Accession Record should be filled out if you know there are other accessions that belong in the same collection.  

1. Select *Add Related Accession*. 
2. In the *Relationship type* drop-down menu, usually choose **Is Sibling of**.
- The language here is confusing. It has to do with hierarchies (Does an accession fall under a previous accession or is it on the same level).  
3. In the **Sibling Relationship** box, fill out the required fields.
- *This Accession* = Is Sibling of
- *Accession* = Search for the related accession you are trying to connect to. Hint: Using the drop-down menu here to *Browse* might be easier when searching.
- *Relator Type* = Automates with "Bound With" relationship.

### Instances

The **Instances** section of the Accession Record is used to track location of materials. If this *isn't* used, just note location the **User Defined** section in *String 1*. Fields marked with * are mandatory (if information is known). Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.

- Click *Link to Locations*.
- If location isn't known, this can be edited and added later. 

In bottom left corner click *Create and Link to Top Container*.

Repeat this for every box. To add more, hover over the bottom of the Instance field and “Add Container Instance” and “Add Digital Object” will appear. Click on “Add Container Instance”. 

When you are finished with the record save and print. For now, print using CTRL + P, or go to the **View** screen of the record (not in Edit mode) and print from there.
