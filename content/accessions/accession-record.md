### Log into [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin)
- URL: [https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/admin).
- The username and password are established upon account creation.

### Create an Accession Record
- In ArchivesSpace, click **Create** located next to the search box.
- From the drop-down menu, click **Accessions**.

**NOTE:** AS only requires 3 fields to create an accession record: *Title, Identifier,* and *Accession Date*. However, these fields are not enough to create a good accession record and it’s important to include more information. You can save a record at any point. You can leave and come back to a record but be sure to click save. The save button is at the top of the record.

The fields listed below should be filled for each accession record. Fields marked with * are mandatory (if information is known). Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.
