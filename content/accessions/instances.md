The **Instances** section of the Accession Record is used to track location of materials. If this *isn't* used, just note location the **User Defined** section in *String 1*. Fields marked with * are mandatory (if information is known). Please consult with department colleagues if questions arise.

{:.table .table-bordered}
| Field | Required | Content | Examples |
| - | ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Type* | Yes | Drop-down menu, typically just use *Accession* for accession records |
| Top Container* | Yes | From drop-down menu, select best description. Usually, *Box*. |
| Container Type | Optional | From drop-down menu, select *Create* |
| Indicator* | Yes | An alphanumeric expression for indicating the place of the highest level container, which may also be the position of the container in a sequence of containers. | Container Type = Box & Indicator = 1 so... Box 1 |

Once **Container Type** and **Indicator** are filled in, you could *Add Location* if one is known. 
- Location* > Browse (drop-down)> choose the exact location. You can filter by text or by links to rooms/areas (for example, type in ‘row: 94’ in the keyword search box to find the small accession shelves).
- Click *Link to Locations*.
- If location isn't known, this can be edited and added later. 

In bottom left corner click *Create and Link to Top Container*.

Repeat this for every box. To add more, hover over the bottom of the Instance field and “Add Container Instance” and “Add Digital Object” will appear. Click on “Add Container Instance”. 

When you are finished with the record save and print. For now, print using CTRL + P, or go to the **View** screen of the record (not in Edit mode) and print from there.
