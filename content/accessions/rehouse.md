Some people like to rehouse materials, then create the record; some create an accession record in [ArchivesSpace (AS)](https://uidaho.libraryhost.com/) first, then rehouse; still others to the process simultaneously. Do what works for you. 

Rehousing before creating accession records can be useful because it allows one to become familiar with the collection and much of the information needed for creating an accession record will be gleaned in the process.   

When possible, collections should be rehoused before they go on the shelf. Most folders and boxes that materials arrive in are not archival quality. For some collections it will be best to put them in archival quality containers now. For others, it might not be the best use of our time. Note that incoming donations and transfer may contain digital storage including CDs, DVDs, zip drives, floppy disks, etc. Digital materials may also be sent via email or cloud file sharing. Be sure to note these in the correct field of the Accession Record in ArchivesSpace.

If analog material is already in folders use your best judgement about whether they should be re-foldered. Feel free to discuss this decision with department colleagues. It is best to preserve original folder titles if they exist, which may mean transcribing folder titles from an older folder to a new archival folder. Another basic tenet of archiving is to preserve the "original order" of records, meaning the arrangement that the collection arrives with. At this stage, try to keep folders in the order and in the same boxes in which they arrived.

Always use pencil when working around archival materials. If the material is not in folders, it is probably best to do some arranging and put them in folders. You can give folders titles if you are making groupings of documents. Note any condition issues in the accession record as you come upon them. Remember it is always best to discuss things with colleagues if you are unsure or would benefit from a second set of eyes.
