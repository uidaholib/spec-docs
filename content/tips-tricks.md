Its hard to remember everything, so this is a list of tips and tricks that will help you locate materials, answer patrons inquiries, and aid in general archival procedures.

### Photo Negatives and Prints

---
#### Duplicates Exist!
If you are looking for a negative/print and can't find it in the folder or box it's supposed to be, try checking the **Copy Negatives** area in the book storage.
- Row 37 (by the table that has things stacked to be put back)
- If a print can't be found, likely a copy negative of it is located here

#### Barnard-Stockbridge photograph collection
    
There are *2* Barnard-Stockbridge photograph collections and *3* places prints/negatives could be located.
- [Barnard-Stockbridge photograph collection - portraits (PG 8-1)](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv949259)
    - Identifiers begin with *numbers*. (Ex: 8-00001, 8-00002a, 8-00002n, etc.)
    - Location: Cage 1, Rows 46-49
        - *Within* the cage, not on the outskirts.
- [Barnard-Stockbridge photograph collection (PG 8-2)](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv407875)
    - Identifiers begin with *letters*. (Ex: 8-A001, 8-A002, etc.)
    - Location: Cage 1, Row 93, Sections 1-2
- Copy negatives could live in the book storage area (Row 37)

### Publications
---
#### Periodicals
Check the mail room on the 4th floor (door across from elevator) for materials added to Spec book collections by the catalogers.
- If there are periodicals that *do not* have a white, acid-free bookmark with a barcode and call number written on it then:
    - Log into [Alma](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/ng/)
        - Contact the Library's Associate Dean for Operations and Access for account setup.
    - Search for the periodical by title
    - Once the correct publication is found, check that the added volume or issue is in the system.
        - If in the system, write the call number somewhere on the cover or inside page **in pencil**.
            - Then shelve.
        - If *not* in the system, contact a cataloger.
- If materials have a bookmark with barcode and call number, shelve in appropriate book collection area.

#### Idaho Law Code
Every so often Spec will receive updated Idaho Law books. These are located in the **Idaho Book Collection**.
- Swap out any new law code books.
- Place older copy in Cage 1, Row, Section, 
    - Do not withdraw catalog from Alma, or change locations.

### Scanners
---
#### Flatbed Scanner
Sometimes the scanner by the small white printer freezes or the computer says it can't connect to it.
- Turn the scanner off. Wait 30 seconds. Turn it back on and wait a few minutes. Then try the program again.

#### Negative Scanner
Can't find the right negative adapter? Check the *Accessories* drawer!
